# Triniate
The open-source repository for Project Triniate, the MMORPG for the Nintendo 3DS Browser. https://triniate.com

# Setting it up
To run Triniate in your own environment, clone this repository on a Linux-based server that runs PHP and MySQL or MariaDB.
First, you'll have to set up the SQL database. The schematic is provided in `mysql_schematic.sql`, so all you have to do is import it.
Next, open `db_info.php` and update it with the correct credentials to connect to your database. Finally, open `github_settings.php` and change `$triniate_homepage` and `$triniate_playpage` to the correct URL's on your server.
Now you should be ready to go!

# Pull Requests are welcome!
Of course, you can create your own Triniate spinoffs by forking this repository (please link back to https://triniate.com), but you can also contribute to the main Triniate game by opening a pull request that I will go over :-)
